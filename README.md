Simple Login System with PHP
================

A very simple PHP script with MySQL backend to store usernames, passwords, and use cookies to protect a member's area.

- To connect with MySQL just fill up missing values in includes/dbh.inc.php
- In folder "dbstructure" you can find ready-ot-use structure for users table.

All code is as-is. No support provided.

Do with it what you will... happy coding! :)
